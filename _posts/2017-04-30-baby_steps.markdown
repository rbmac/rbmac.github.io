The suggested topic for this blog post is boxes. I, however, have not *quite* gotten to boxes in the curriculum yet...and by 'quite' I mean that it's at least fifteen lessons away. And the post is ten days overdue. So here I am, *not* writing about boxes.

I had hoped to move through the lessons a little more quickly. But work and kids and obligations have a way of derailing the most ambitious study schedule. Plus, it's baseball season, and spring, and finally above 30 degrees (I live in Northern New York...that's a big deal)! So rather than lament the fact that I'm not as far along as I'd hoped, I'm going to reflect on what I *have* accomplished:

* I've written a functioning (if basic) Tic Tac Toe game in Ruby, and made everyone in my house (and possibly a couple of the neighbor kids) play it at least twice. I am ridiculously proud of my Tic Tac Toe game, and am even looking forward to revisiting it in later lessons.
* I've worked through countless errors and failed tests, and learned to read the error messages, which was enormously helpful and time-saving.
* I've built the basic outline of a website for a fictional realty company. 
* I've made Neil deGrasse Tyson's Twitter feed say, "Hello, Rebecca!" That was exciting, even if no one else will ever see it.

Most importantly, though, I've begun to envision myself as a developer; to realize that, despite the tedium and slow pace, I *am* making progress. A page of code no longer looks like Aramaic--I can pick out elements and commands that I understand, and I can follow the logic even if many of the details are still above my head. I don't know if this path will lead to viable career opportunities, but I am enjoying the process.
