My husband joined the Army right after I graduated from college, and right after we had our second child. In the first ten years of his career, we moved five times and had a third child. Moving every two or three years, while raising small children, makes it extremely difficult to build a career. I have a degree in Political Science that I've never used, and every six months or so, I start looking at graduate programs in various fields. I never follow through, however, because I'm reluctant to spend an enormous amount of money on something I may or may not be able to capitalize on. I take as many free classes as I can, though, both online and in whatever community I'm calling home at that moment, because I strongly believe that there is no such thing as too much knowledge, and because I enjoy them.

The idea of coding has always interested me, but in much the same way that the idea of magic interests me...and I probably know more about magic, thanks to T.H. White and J.K. Rowling. When I saw a post about military spouses in tech with links to free coding tutorials, I clicked on a link, started a tutorial on codecademy.com on HTML, and was immediately fascinated. It is remarkably empowering to read a line of code that looked like gibberish a few hours before, and UNDERSTAND IT, even if you know it's ridiculously simple code. That flash of understanding is addictive.

Initially, coding tutorials were just something new to learn. Eventually, I began to realize that this might be something I could translate into a career; one that could move with me to each new duty location, that I could do from home, and on my own schedule. My kids are all in school and reasonably independent, but I still want to be able to go to soccer games and swim meets, and to be home and available at least a few afternoons a week. The nature of life in a military community means that their environment is fluid and often changing, and I hope having one constant helps.

A few weeks after taking my first tutorial, I saw another Facebook post for a scholarship opportunity for military dependents for the Flatiron School. I started the free Bootcamp at Flatiron, and filled out the application. I didn't expect to win, and I'm not sure I had fully processed the idea of actually going back to school, and the work that that entails.  Despite my lack of mental preparation, since starting the program, I find myself looking forward to the times when I can sit down and work on the lessons with enthusiasm rather than reluctance or dread, so I think it's off to great start!

Whether this is the start of a successful career, or just an opportunity to learn something new remains to be seen. Either way, it's the beginning of a new adventure, and I'm excited to see where it takes me!
